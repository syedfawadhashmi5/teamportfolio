Idea Development

In Pakistan there are multiple software houses and marketing agencies that are running separately so we want to combine them together where the client can get all the easily access to all the things that he/she wants
Like if a client comes to us and wants an application for his business we can create a website or app for him and we can also offer that app or website marketing offer to him so he can access all the things in one place and save himself from the headache of dealing with two different kinds of agencies.
So we want to build a business where we combine the services of technical and non technical fields and we also want to make it a learning institute for the students.

Friends
From Facebook groups to know that our idea is profitable or workable in pakistan or not
Took surveys and feedback from clients that if we provide them a platform where they can get the whole services for their business and deal with only one company so we can corporate them in future for there projects
We will ask our target audience if there they are willing to do the projects like these in the future with us
